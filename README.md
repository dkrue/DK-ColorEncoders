# DK-ColorEncoders
This was an Arduino project that lets you control randomized light effects in an upcycled candle jar.

## How it works
One knob controls the light effect speed, and the other controls color. Pressing the knobs down switch the algorithm mode. Put them all together an you have unlimited number of effects to discover!
## Ingredients
This was made using an inexpensive Pro Micro board, LED ring, and two rotary encoders. I found two copper colored knobs on eBay to match the metal cap from a door I had in my junk collection. It turned out to be a nice lookin' gift!
